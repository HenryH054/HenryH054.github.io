I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
 Web dev requires so much patient for making incremental changes that give seemingly barely any results, like moving the image here making sure that some margin call is working appropriately and so on. Let alone the infamous missing semi-colon in CSS that seems to break so much stuff out of nowhere. It's truly a work of patience, maybe one day I'll have the kind of patience that makes me enjoy website making but at this moment as I'm wrapping up and writing this review I'm on the edge of seething granted part of that may be because I have a dog next to me who won't be quiet for more than a few minutes. Dog sitting is work. Regardless overall I'm glad I did this assignment, can't say it draws me any closer to wanting to do web dev though.
