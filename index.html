I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection (1-2 paragraphs): 
HTML is so exciting! I wish I could say to be honest html is the drag of the majority of my projects I really enjoy the semantics and the nitty gritty of coding and html seems to take that away from me. Aside from the part where it isn't a turing complete language, but with that said I do understand it's purpose in the modern atmosphere and it does make designing UIs so much easier than having to write an engine from scratch in C every time so for that I am grateful for it even if I wish I could do more stuff in raw HTML, but I suppose javascript will have to suffice with that gap.

			<h2>A Wizard of Today</h2>
			<p>
				We have long since lived in a world where we say magic no longer exists, but if we
				simply open our eyes we are surrounded by magic. Afterall,
				what's more magical saying some words to have a light turn appear from thin air or
				uttering some words
				into your phone and a technicolor display appears as if from no where.
			</p>
			<p class="haiku">
				In circuits and code,<br>
				Magic whispers through the wiresâ€”<br>
				Logic's light unfolds.

			<h2>My Interests</h2>
			<p>The only thing more interesting to me than the magic in which we encompass ourselves about
				everyday is learning to harness it and have it do as I wish. It allows me to simplify my
				life, better the lives of the people around me, and hopefully make at least a bit of
				money at some point. Learning to harness that magic is also a puzzle that seemingly
				endlessly unfolds as we layer through the though process of the engineers before us and
				as we understand that we learn to harness magic as a true wizard would.</p>
			<p>As exciting as being a wizard is though being away from it all is such a relieving feeling.
				Getting to the middle of a forest or barren wasteland and being surrounded by nothing
				except my thoughts, the people I'm with, and nature is perhaps my favorite feeling. It
				allows for a level of decompression that doesn't exist elsewhere and it allows for a
				type of peace as we reconnect with our ancestors who knew only those barren wastelands
				and lush forests</p>
			<p>Next up I love my cat, she's adorable and I love watching her be playful it reminds me of a
				sort of inner child that I use to possess and now have to drag out. Having my adorable
				little cat, named Yoki bytheway, also allows for me to ground myself into what matters
				and what doesn't. I had a bad nack of stressing myself into oblivion before I realized
				that I could just take breaks and be myself for a little and Yoki is what especially
				reminds me of that when I'm 6 hours deep into homework with 4 more hours to go.</p>
